```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(readr, quietly = TRUE)
library(data.table, quietly = TRUE)

Will read an input and search for n-grams 


```{r cars}
start <- read.csv("/Users/mutecypher/Documents/Coursera/Capstone Project/20sample/nosingles_bi_ns_ns.csv", colClasses = c(NA, NA, NA))
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
