## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r analysis}
shrink_bi <- read.csv(file = "/Users/mutecypher/Documents/Documents - Michael’s iMac/Coursera/Capstone Project/processed/shrink_bi.csv", colClasses = c("NULL", NA, NA, "NULL"))
shrink_bi <- data.table(shrink_bi)
setkey(shrink_bi, word1)
shrink_tri <- read.csv(file = "/Users/mutecypher/Documents/Documents - Michael’s iMac/Coursera/Capstone Project/processed/shrink_tri.csv", colClasses = c("NULL", NA, NA, "NULL"))
shrink_tri <- data.table(shrink_tri)
setkey(shrink_tri, bigrams)
shrink_quad <- read.csv(file = "/Users/mutecypher/Documents/Documents - Michael’s iMac/Coursera/Capstone Project/processed/shrink_quad.csv", colClasses = c("NULL", NA, NA, "NULL"))
shrink_quad <- data.table(shrink_quad)
setkey(shrink_quad, trigrams)
shrink_quin <- read.csv(file = "/Users/mutecypher/Documents/Documents - Michael’s iMac/Coursera/Capstone Project/processed/shrink_quin.csv", colClasses = c("NULL", NA, NA, "NULL"))
shrink_quin <- data.table(shrink_quin)
setkey(shrink_quin, quadgrams)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r more process, echo=FALSE}
print(shrink_quad["no one ever"])
print(shrink_quin["all over the place"])
print(shrink_tri["she's not"])
print(shrink_bi["i'm"])
print(shrink_quad["a case of"])
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
